    <p> Hi! My name is Ashley Mazarin and I am currently a Junior attending Roslyn High School.  It has been my mission to help out the Navajos on the Indian reservation in Arizona.  Last year, I visited a few times and helped their community by chopping firewood, delivering groceries, and educating myself on their way of life.  I ultimately decided I wanted to do more for them and thus, "Notebooks for Navajos" was created. </p>
        
        <br>
    
    <p> "Notebooks for Navajos" collected about 650 pounds of school supplies from my local elementary and middle school.  I traveled down to Arizona with my dad and hand delivered the supplies to students and even some teachers.  During these trying times I still am trying all I can to help their community
